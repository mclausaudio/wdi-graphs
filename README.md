### Vertex
- also known as node
- holds individual data element of a graph

### Edge
- also known as arc
- the connecting link between two vertices

## Types of Graphs

<img width="651" alt="graph example" src="https://github.com/mclausaudio/wdi-graphs/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-03%20at%2011.12.31%20AM.png">

Graphs can be **undirected** or **directed**.

**Undirected**: if 6 was a friend of 4, 4 would likewise be a friend of 6. The relationship exists in both directions :dancers:. 

**Directed**: if 6 has a crush on 4; doesn't necessarily mean 4 has to have a crush on 6. Feelings may not be reciprocal :broken_heart:. 

From these examples, these relationships are based on the direction of the edges. It can be a one way or two way relationship but it must be stated.
